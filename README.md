# Continuous Testing with Travis CI and LambdaTest

This repo serves as a demonstration on how to run a [TestCafe](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/) test suite using the [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/) cloud-based cross browser testing tool and the [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) continuous integration service.

The TestCafe test suite is based on the finalized example code used for the book [**_End-to-End Testing with TestCafe_**](https://testingwithtestcafe.com/). To run the tests, you must have TestCafe installed and have a valid TeamYap account as specified in the book. The login information inside the tests need to be updated to your TeamYap accounts as needed. Make sure to update the credentials inside the `login_test.js` and `helpers/roles.js` files.

For more information about the book, go to [https://testingwithtestcafe.com/](https://testingwithtestcafe.com/). Sign up to the mailing list and receive the first three chapters of the book free!
